**Horizontal Scaling:**
Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, is the practice of increasing the capacity of a system by adding more machines or nodes to a distributed network or cluster. In this approach, each new machine or server operates independently and shares the load with existing ones. This helps distribute the workload evenly and improve performance and reliability. Horizontal scaling is often associated with applications designed to run in a distributed or cloud-based environment. It allows for easy expansion as traffic and data volumes grow, promoting scalability and fault tolerance. While it can be cost-effective and straightforward to implement, it may require careful management to ensure that the added nodes work seamlessly together and that data consistency is maintained across the cluster.

**Vertical Scaling:**
Vertical scaling, or scaling up, involves enhancing the performance of a single machine or server by increasing its resources, such as CPU, memory, or storage capacity. It is a traditional method of improving system performance and is commonly associated with monolithic applications. Vertical scaling can offer improved performance to a certain extent but may have limitations due to hardware constraints. As resources on a single machine are finite, vertical scaling can become expensive and complex as further upgrades are needed. It is often used when the application's growth is predictable, and a single powerful machine can meet the demands. However, for rapidly growing or highly dynamic systems, horizontal scaling is often preferred for its flexibility and scalability.
